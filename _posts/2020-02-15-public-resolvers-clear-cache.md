Did you know some pubic DNS resolvers give you the ability to clear there cache?

Why would you want to do this you ask?

Well, what if you have you TTL's set high and you unintentionally broke something.

With resolvers that let us clear there cache, we can reduce the impact something like this has.

Below are the resolves I have found that let you do this.
